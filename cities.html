	  <h1>Smart Cities</h1>
		<p>With the rise of the current century, our world witnessed a remarkable growth of urbanization, a gradual increase in the proportion of people living in urban areas. As Michele Penza et al. suggest it is anticipated that in less than one generation more than two thirds of the planet population will live in urbanized areas and megacities. At the same time, human needs for evolution and development, industriesâ€™ demand for supplies and productivity, yet our habits, all of them fed and spread the affair of environmental degradation. Given that, a possible key-solution is to protect and maintain our sources as well as monitor our wastes in order to reach a more ecological and sustainable conscience. 
		<p>For that purpose, smart cities in conjunction with the ICT (information and communications technologies), applied in our urban societies can overthrow the current situation and serve as a powerful vehicle for green and eco-friendly development. Such structures include several applications where sociotechnical interaction between citizens and pervasive devices a.k.a. Internet of Things (IoT) is often needed (Khan et al, 2012). Intelligent cities and sustainable systems aim at improving the quality of life in urban environments, such as addressing scientific and technological innovations, establishing friendly and livable communities and promoting balanced and resilient development. As the International Telecommunication Union underlines in their report2, cities represent 75% of the total energy consumption and 80% of CO2 emissions on global basis, highlighting the impact of cities in the environment. In favor of that point, studies have demonstrated that only in building sector, which accounts for 40% of the energy consumption of Europe, ICT use can lead to a reduction of around 10% in total energy consumption.</p> 
		<p>Even though cities consist of countless physical structures, the assistance of new technologies such as the cloud computing, the Internet of Things, the network of sensors and smart meters enhances the mapping of all the assets and infrastructures of smart sustainable cities. The role played by ICTs in Smart Sustainable Cities is crucial, due to their ability to act as a digital platform from which an information and knowledge network can be created. For instance, environmental sensors can automatically collect data from the environment e.g. water, air quality to name but a few, and transform them into useful information for the system. However such a challenge requires contemporary ICT solutions capable of storing and processing significant amount of data and produce intelligent contextual information (Zaheer Khan et al, 2012). Hence, the effective and efficient design and implementation of waste management system requires understanding, adjustment and optimal correlation of all modern IT standards applications and city needs. Summarizing, Smart government services and smart public infrastructures, which are either completely novel or greatly superior to their traditional predecessor counterparts in terms of ease of use, comprehensiveness, effectiveness, efficiency, and high-speed interconnectedness, are seen as hallmarks of a smart city and its government in the 21st century (Washburn et al, 2010).</p>
